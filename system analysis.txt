A Hotel Management System for Automated Reservation and Guest Services

SYSTEM ANALYSIS

1. Introduction

The Hotel Management System for Automated Reservation and Guest Services is a web-based application developed to automate hotel operations such as room management, reservation handling, and guest services. The system replaces traditional manual processes with a digital solution that ensures efficiency, accuracy, security, and better customer experience.

This project is designed using modern web technologies:

Frontend: React

Backend: Node.js with Express

Database: MongoDB

The system supports role-based access for Admin and Customer, ensuring secure and controlled operations.

2. Problem Definition

In many hotels, room reservations and guest records are still managed manually or using semi-automated tools like spreadsheets. This approach leads to several operational challenges such as booking conflicts, data inconsistency, delayed services, and poor customer satisfaction.

The absence of a centralized and automated system makes it difficult to manage room availability, track bookings, and maintain accurate records.

3. Existing System Analysis
3.1 Description of Existing System

The existing system is mostly manual and involves:

Phone or walk-in reservations

Paper-based record keeping

Manual payment tracking

No centralized database

Limited security

3.2 Limitations of Existing System

High probability of human errors

No real-time room availability

Difficult to manage large data

Poor data security

Time-consuming operations

No role-based access

Difficult to generate reports

4. Proposed System Overview

The proposed system is a fully automated Hotel Management System that digitally manages all hotel operations. It allows users to register, login, browse rooms, make reservations, and complete payments, while administrators manage rooms and monitor bookings.

The system ensures real-time data updates, secure authentication, and centralized data storage.

5. Objectives of the System

To automate hotel room reservations

To provide real-time room availability

To reduce manual work and human errors

To ensure secure user authentication

To maintain centralized and reliable data storage

6. Scope of the System

The scope of the system includes:

User registration and authentication

Role-based access (Admin and Customer)

Room management

Booking management

Payment data storage within bookings

Booking history and monitoring

Future enhancements may include:

Online payment gateway integration

Invoice generation

Email/SMS notifications

Cancellation and refund management

Admin analytics dashboard

7. Advantages of the Proposed System
